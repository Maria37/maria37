  The end goal of this project is to look at the median household income of census block groups in various states and compare 
  
them to the monetary damage caused by tornadoes. I want to see if it is possible to predict damage and loss (both monetary 

and demographical) for certain areas based on the socio-economic class. I want to be able to look at today’s economy in terms 

of demographics and monetary value of land and account for these values in terms of storm damage. For example, do areas with 

lower income accrue a higher percentage of damage/loss from these storms? I have data for tornadoes from the mid 1950’s to 2017. 

The dataset contains the scale of the tornadoes, physical attributes of the storms, as well as the amount of damage in terms of 

money and casualties. My goal is to look at the census data of the areas where the storms affected and determine how the 

damage amount correlates with socio-economic classes. 

  I took this data and separated the storms by the year that they occurred and then by the state in which they occurred.
  
I would have to join the census block group attribute table with the tornado dataset table (possibly by the state name column). If 
I cannot find a similar column to join the two tables I will take one tornado from each year (eight tornadoes per state) 

and make an excel table. Based on where the location of the tornadoes are I would then use the data to see if

the most damage occured where the average income was lower. I would determine the percentage of damage in each social class. Then I 

would run a Moran’s I model in GeoDa to see if these two factors are indeed correlated as I hypothesized. 

  In this class I learned how to use python to fix symbology and to make a presentable project. I will use this to
  
create the best looking project that I can make. I chose this subject because I am interested in the socio-economic differences in 
housing. I believe that I will be able to tell if an area is poor based on the amount of damage it accrues 

during a storm. 

  On my own durng this class, I learned how I can classify data using python. I did this during project 2 and it turned out very
  
well!
